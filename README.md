# landing-project
Hey guys. Today I made my first webpage using HTML and designed with CSS called (Landing Page).  I tried my best making it as close as I could to the design images. And then I fit my own business content hoping that I will Tech company oneday. 
I will put the html and css files for you to checkout. And if you like, just let me know by contacting me through my email adress.

One more thing, I really didn't think about commiting my process through git, because I had a problem with commit messegs.
